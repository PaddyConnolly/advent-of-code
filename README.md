# 🎄 Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Day 1

Very rusty on C++, got the first part straight away, second part took me a while as was trying different hacks for the edge cases. Eventually restarted and got it not too long after that.

## Day 2

A lot more straight forward, got the first one quickly by splitting in half, then extended that to split by all factors for the second. Tried to get it fully mathematically, but ended up going for a string-based solution in the end.

## Day 3

Got the first part with an intuitive 'check-if-first-digit-bigger, check-if-second-digit-bigger' solution. Took some time to come up with the second part, but when I actually planned it instead of just writing code first, I got it instantly. First time using a C++ unordered map.

## Day 4

Very quick one today, on the first part I got the correct answer on the first try, which is the first time that happened, I think the new planning method works a lot better. The second part took slightly longer, but only because I forgot to reset the counts when looping through.

## Day 5

First part took a while, forgot about the possibility of overlapping ranges, but once I rebuilt it with range merging it made the second part easy.

## Day 6

Again first part was simple, and got tripped up on second part for a long time because I read the question wrong, I was interpreting 8 (space) (space) as 800, and not 8.

## Day 7

Much quicker one, almost got tripped up again by not reading the question for the first part (I was counting beams at the end not total splits). Came up with a recursive solution for the second part which took too long at first but added memoisation which fixed the issue.

## Day 8

Definitely the hardest so far, lots of research required into Disjoint Set Unions. However it was probably one of the easiest second part follow-ups, only required a slight tweak.
