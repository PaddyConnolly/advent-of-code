# 🎄 Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) — the annual Christmas-themed coding challenge.

## ✨ What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. Each day brings a new two-part challenge that can be solved in any language.

## Day 1

Very rusty on C++, got the first part straight away, second part took me a while as was trying different hacks for the edge cases. Eventually restarted and got it not too long after that.

## Day 2

A lot more straight forward, got the first one quickly by splitting in half, then extended that to split by all factors for the second. Tried to get it fully mathematically, but ended up going for a string-based solution in the end.
