# 🎄 Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) — the annual Christmas-themed coding challenge.

## ✨ What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. Each day brings a new two-part challenge that can be solved in any language.
